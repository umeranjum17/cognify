# RevenueCat Paywall Flow Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated RevenueCat Configuration
**File:** `lib/config/subscriptions_config.dart`
- Updated Android key placeholder to use proper format (`apx_placeholder_replace_with_real_key`)
- Added clear comments about getting the correct Android SDK API Key (Client) from RevenueCat
- Emphasized NOT to use Secret API keys in the app

### 2. Fixed Subscription Provider Logout Issue
**File:** `lib/providers/subscription_provider.dart`
- **Problem:** Calling `Purchases.logOut()` when the current RC user is anonymous causes errors
- **Solution:** Removed the logout call when user signs out, only refresh offerings and customer info
- **Impact:** Prevents "Called logOut but the current user is anonymous" errors

### 3. Enhanced Paywall Purchase Flow
**File:** `lib/screens/subscription/paywall_screen.dart`
- **Updated `_purchase()` method:** Now implements the approved Android-first flow:
  1. Check if user is signed in
  2. If not signed in, trigger Google Sign-In first
  3. After sign-in, identify with RevenueCat using the UID
  4. Refresh offerings to show correct packages
  5. Proceed with purchase
- **Updated "Continue with Google" button:** Also identifies with RevenueCat after sign-in
- **Fixed imports:** Removed duplicate import statements

## Approved User Flow (Android)

1. **User taps premium-gated action** → navigate to PaywallScreen
2. **Paywall loads offerings** (requires correct `apx_` key)
3. **User taps Continue:**
   - Google Sign-In (Firebase)
   - On success: `RevenueCatService.identify(uid)`
   - Then `RevenueCatService.purchasePackage(selected)`
4. **On purchase success:** return to previous screen and show entitlement enabled

## Key Benefits

- **Ensures RC App User ID is linked to Firebase UID** at purchase time
- **Avoids anonymous-only purchases** in the chosen flow
- **Keeps cross-device restore and account linking sane**
- **Prevents "anonymous logout" errors** by not calling logout on anonymous users

## Next Steps

1. **Get the Android SDK API Key (Client)** from RevenueCat:
   - RevenueCat → Apps & providers → Select your Android app → SDK API Keys (Client)
   - Copy the Android SDK API Key (starts with `apx_...`)

2. **Replace the placeholder key:**
   - Update `SubscriptionsConfig.rcPublicKeyAndroid` in `lib/config/subscriptions_config.dart`

3. **Do a full hot-restart** (not just hot-reload) after changing the key

4. **Test the flow:**
   - Open paywall → offerings load with prices
   - Tap Continue → Google Sign-In → app returns with UID
   - RC identifies to UID → purchase completes
   - Entitlement premium is active in `CustomerInfo` → gated premium toggles on
   - Restore purchases flow works from PaywallScreen

## Files Modified

- `lib/config/subscriptions_config.dart` - Updated key format and comments
- `lib/providers/subscription_provider.dart` - Fixed anonymous logout issue
- `lib/screens/subscription/paywall_screen.dart` - Enhanced purchase flow with sign-in
- `test_revenuecat_flow.dart` - Created test file for verification

## Error Prevention

- **Secret API Key Error (7243):** Fixed by using Android SDK API Key (Client) format
- **Anonymous Logout Error:** Fixed by not calling logout on anonymous users
- **Provider Lookup Error:** Fixed by ensuring proper provider mounting and hot-restart
- **Empty Offerings:** Fixed by using correct API key format

The implementation now follows the approved Android-first flow and should work correctly once the real RevenueCat API key is provided.

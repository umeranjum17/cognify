# Model Registry Removed

The frontend model registry (`cognify-flutter/lib/config/model_registry.dart`) has been removed as requested because:

1. **Redundancy**: It duplicated functionality that's available from the server API
2. **Live Data**: The server provides real-time OpenRouter model data with input modalities
3. **Single Source of Truth**: Server-side registry is the authoritative source
4. **Better UX**: Enhanced model selection screen provides comprehensive filtering and sorting

## Replaced With:

- **Enhanced Model Selection Screen**: Comprehensive UI with live data from server
- **Server API Integration**: Direct calls to `/api/models` endpoints
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Live input modalities detection from OpenRouter
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by provider, modalities, pricing, features

## Benefits:

✅ **No Data Duplication**: Single source of truth on server
✅ **Always Up-to-Date**: Live OpenRouter model data
✅ **Better Performance**: Server-side caching with 1-hour TTL
✅ **Enhanced Features**: Advanced filtering, sorting, search
✅ **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns

The enhanced model selection now provides a much better user experience with comprehensive model information and filtering capabilities.
